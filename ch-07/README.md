# Tips:

It seens that is possible to inject unix code using html input from form. 

we need a way to list all files in directory of script file and make a request to the file witch contains the password

In unix the semicolon allow us to use many terminal commands in one line at once, where each command is executed in order, just like

cd ~; ls;

This will allow you to list all files in directory where the cal.pl file is.

this is a cal command by default so everything that need to be done is put this in input field

    ; ls

this is the same a type: cal ; ls on your linux terminal

you will see that this will make a call to the first command and execute ls after that

Now all we have to do is make a request to that file
/filethatyoufound.php ---- this is just an example
